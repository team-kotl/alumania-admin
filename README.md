# Alumania App
## Client-Side and Server-Side Web Scripting

### TASK GUIDE: Team Activity

This activity should enable you to:

● Utilize the core language of JavaScript, the Document Object Model (DOM), and other APIs to implement client side logic and generate dynamic Web
content.

● Utilize the basic features of PHP in order to provide server-side features on data processing

● To demonstrate how client-side and server-side scripting technologies, together with HTML and CSS, can be integrated.

### Guidelines

1. Use vanilla code for all technologies used in the application (no using of Bootstrap, JQuery, etc.). Any external fonts and multimedia resources should be downloaded locally.
2. Use the DOM API as the primary means to generate web content dynamically.
3. Please note the minimum requirements for server-side functionality:
- Add data to the database.
- The added data will be used for information display, which should contain basic filter/search and sort options.
4. The above features are expected to be in the same module (that is, for the same user role/type). However, some may opt to have data entry in one module, such that the saved data will be viewed by the other user role/type) in the other module.

### Deliverables:
1. Document with the following format and content:
- Format
- Folio (8.5x13 page size)
- Arial font, size 11
2. Physical Database (please include Create Schema to facilitate the import process).
3. Project Folder archived in .zip format. Organize the web resources accordingly to prevent broken links and broken code. Provide a readme file, if necessary.
4. Use the naming conventions: teamname-mid.pdf, teamname-mid.sql and
teamname-mid.zip for #1, #2 and #3 respectively.
