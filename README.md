# Module 4 & Module 5, Part 1
## Client-Side and Server-Side Web Scripting

### TASK GUIDE: Team Activity

Objectives: This activity should enable you to:
● Utilize the core language of JavaScript, the Document Object Model (DOM),
and other APIs to implement client side logic and generate dynamic Web
content.
● Utilize the basic features of PHP in order to provide server-side features on data
processing
● To demonstrate how client-side and server-side scripting technologies, together
with HTML and CSS, can be integrated.
Guidelines:
	1. Use vanilla code for all technologies used in the application (no using of
Bootstrap, JQuery, etc.). Any external fonts and multimedia resources should be
downloaded locally.
	2. Use the DOM API as the primary means to generate web content dynamically.
	3. Please note the minimum requirements for server-side functionality:
		a. Add data to the database.
		b. The added data will be used for information display, which should contain
		basic filter/search and sort options.

4. The above features are expected to be in the same module (that is, for the same
user role/type). However, some may opt to have data entry in one module, such
that the saved data will be viewed by the other user role/type) in the other
module.

### Deliverables:
1. Document with the following format and content:
	a. Format
		● Folio (8.5x13 page size)
		● Arial font, size 11
	b. Content
		● Cover page that contains the team name, class code,
		alphabetical list of members
	● Wireframes (with annotations as needed). The implemented
	features of the system should be traceable to the prototype.
	● Screenshots of the implemented features of the application.
	● Peer Accomplishment Report
2. Physical Database (please include Create Schema to facilitate the import
process).
3. Project Folder archived in .zip format. Organize the web resources accordingly
to prevent broken links and broken code. Provide a readme file, if necessary.
4. Use the naming conventions: teamname-mid.pdf, teamname-mid.sql and
teamname-mid.zip for #1, #2 and #3 respectively.
